This is a simple web based program that reports the keystroke number that is input from the keyboard.

Key Code is the special ASCII value given to each key
on the keyboard. These keycode was accessed using the
window.addEventListner("keydown", function(e){
    //Here E is the object of whatever the key stroke is.
    //Looking at the console we get in-depth knowledge of
    // this key and then I found that using key.keyCode
    // will give the key code which we displayed on the screen.
});
